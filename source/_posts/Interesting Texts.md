> The second edition of the book under review appeared in 1971 enriched by updating appendices one for each chapter, which were written by S.S. Abhyankar, J. Lipman, and D. Mumford. These ten appendices gave outlines of the developments of algebraic surface theory during the period from 1935 to 1970, connecting in this way Zariski's original classic text to the methods and results of abstract modern algebraic geometry. The present edition is an unchanged reprint of the second edition from 1971.

> This is an introduction to elementary number theory from a geometric point of view, in contrast to the usual strictly algebraic approach. A large part of the book is devoted to studying quadratic forms in two variables with integer coefficients, a very classical topic going back to Fermat, Euler, Lagrange, Legendre, and Gauss, but from a perspective that emphasizes Conway's much more recent notion of the topograph of a quadratic form. The book has been published by the AMS in 2022 as a paperback, ISBN 978-1-4704-5611-5. See the [AMS webpage for the book](https://bookstore.ams.org/mbk-145/).

S. Ramanan - **Global Calculus**
> Analysis, topology and algebra brought new power to geometry, revolutionizing the way geometers and physicists look at conceptual problems. Some of the key ingredients in this interplay are sheaves, cohomology, Lie groups, connections and differential operators. In Global Calculus, the appropriate formalism for these topics is laid out with numerous examples and applications by one of the experts in differential and algebraic geometry.

Ramanan has chosen an uncommon but natural path through the subject. In this almost completely self-contained account, these topics are developed from scratch. The basics of Fourier transforms, Sobolev theory and interior regularity are proved at the same time as symbol calculus, culminating in beautiful results in global analysis, real and complex. Many new perspectives on traditional and modern questions of differential analysis and geometry are the hallmarks of the book.

The book is suitable for a first year graduate course on global analysis.

> Combinatorics is a book whose main theme is the study of subsets of a finite set. It gives a thorough grounding in the theories of set systems and hypergraphs, while providing an introduction to matroids, designs, combinatorial probability and Ramsey theory for infinite sets. The gems of the theory are emphasized: beautiful results with elegant proofs. The book developed from a course at Louisiana State University and combines a careful presentation with the informal style of those lectures. It should be an ideal text for senior undergraduates and beginning graduates.

Jeffrey Humpherys, Tyler J. Jarvis - **Foundations of Applied Mathematics Volume 1: Mathematical Analysis and Volume 2: Algorithms, Approximation, Optimization**
XIn-She Yang, Xing-Shi He - **Mathematical Foundations of Nature-Inspired Algorithms**
> The book begins with a short introduction that describes general principles of constrained and unconstrained optimization of univariate and multivariate functions. It then quickly summarizes several versions of gradient-based algorithms including the usual ones (steepest descent and conjugate gradient) as well as more advanced ones like stochastic gradient and subgradient methods.
Having set the stage with these more conventional algorithms, the authors describe a series of nature-inspired algorithms. They note that the “no-free-lunch” theorems proved in 1997 tell us that there is no best algorithm for solving all optimization problems because all algorithms are equally effective (or ineffective) when measured by average performance across all possible problems. Consequently, the authors consider nature-inspired algorithms that can be matched to specific kinds of applications. Algorithms they describe go by names such as particle swarm optimization, the bat algorithm, the firefly algorithm, and cuckoo search. Several of these algorithms are based on the idea of swarm intelligence. The aim of a swarming system is to allow the system to evolve and converge into stable states that include those with optimal performance. 
The authors devote a couple of chapters to the analysis of algorithms. This has some general aspects (convergence, stability and robustness) as well as details that apply to the nature-inspired algorithms (determining and tuning of parameters and statistical characterization of performance). A final chapter describes some applications of nature-inspired algorithms that the authors have discovered. These include design optimization in engineering, image processing, vehicle routing and scheduling.
This is not a textbook and has no exercises. Most of the topics considered get very abbreviated treatments and many of the discussions of the algorithms are disappointingly sketchy. Even the algorithm analysis sections are short on detail. Critics have suggested that the elaborate metaphors of some nature-inspired algorithms have hidden their lack of novelty or effectiveness. There is just not enough detail in this book to allow any judgment in that direction.
The book is probably best suited as an inspiration for an independent project that might take one of the algorithms and fill out details of analysis and performance. The book’s level of sophistication varies, but most topics are accessible to upper level undergraduates.

Heinz Hopf - **Selected Chapters of Geometry**
> This is a write-up by Hans Samelson of lectures by Hopf in a course at ETH in the summer of 1940. The four chapters are: 
Euler's Formula.
Graphs.
The Four Vertex Theorem and Related Matters.
The Isoperimetric Inequality.
These total just 41 pages. There is quite a bit of overlap with notes from another course of the same title taught by Hopf at New York University in 1946 and published as the first part of volume 1000 of the Springer Lecture Notes. The 1946 course seems to have covered slightly more material, but Samelson's write-up of the earlier course is more polished and has a more pleasing appearance, being in TEX with nice electronically-drawn figures.

Terence Tao - **Poincaré’s Legacies Part I/II**
> Part I of the second-year posts focuses on ergodic theory, combinatorics, and number theory. Chapter 2 consists of lecture notes from Tao's course on topological dynamics and ergodic theory. By means of various correspondence principles, recurrence theorems about dynamical systems are used to prove some deep theorems in combinatorics and other areas of mathematics. In addition to these lectures, a variety of other topics are discussed, ranging from recent developments in additive prime number theory to expository articles on individual mathematical topics such as the law of large numbers and the Lucas–Lehmer test for Mersenne primes. Some selected comments and feedback from blog readers have also been incorporated into the articles.
> Part I of the second-year posts focuses on geometry, topology, and partial differential equations. The major part of the book consists of lecture notes from Tao's course on the Poincaré conjecture and its recent spectacular solution by Perelman. The course incorporates a review of many of the basic concepts and results needed from Riemannian geometry and, to a lesser extent, from parabolic PDE. The aim is to cover in detail the high-level features of the argument, along with selected specific components of that argument, while sketching the remaining elements, with ample references to more complete treatments. In addition to these lectures, a variety of other topics are discussed, including expository articles on topics such as gauge theory, the Kakeya needle problem, and the Black–Scholes equation. Some selected comments and feedback from blog readers have also been incorporated into the articles.
> The lectures are as self-contained as possible, focusing more on the “big picture” than on technical details.
